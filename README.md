View the demo https://dohill06.github.io/techdegree-project-3/

This project enhances an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf" using the jQuery library. The form is made to be more user friendly by adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity. It also validates user input and provides helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields. This project was created for the purpose of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.
